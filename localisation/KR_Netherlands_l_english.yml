 holst.1.t:0 "Netherlands in 1936"
 holst.1.d:0 "The Netherlands was one of the few countries in Europe remaining their neutrality in the Weltkrieg, despite discussions about joining the war on the side of Germany. The Netherlands profited from post Weltkrieg economic boom, however a considerable part of its economy is in German hands, with large scale investments done by German companies. Furthermore, leftist ideas have been gaining a foothold in the Netherlands ever since the fall of France and Britain to Syndicalism, with opposing idealogies also gaining momentum. The Dutch democracy surely will be tested with tensions around the world rising and economic propserity weakining."
 holst.1.a:0 "Leve de koningin!"
 holst.2.t:0 "The Berlin Stock Market Crashes!"
 holst.2.d:0 "On February 3rd, 1936, the Berlin stock market crashed, plunging the world into a depression. Our nation has strong economic ties with Germany and many German companies are shutting down their Dutch factories."
 holst.2.a:0 "This could be bad" 
 holst.3.t:0 "Jordaan Riots"
 holst.3.d:0 "The Jordaan district of Amsterdam, traditionally a socialist stronghold, has erupted into violence.\n\nDissatisfaction with the inadequate unemployment provisions provided by the current government have, likely after prodding and agitation by syndicalist or council communist organisations, boiled over into a public protest, which turned into a riot as several groups of young men in black uniforms appeared out of the alleyways and descended on the crowd with clubs, bricks and broken bottles.\n\n With the police unable to restore order, the mayor was forced to call in several army units to disperse the crowds."
 holst.3.a:0 "Things are going to shit."
 holst.4.t:0 "Lijst Links: The VDB-SDAP Electoral Pact"
 holst.4.d:0 "The formation of the overwhelmingly powerful right-wing CNA sent shockwaves through parliament and society alike. As expected, it is proving an unpopular move with many of the more devout believers, who have jumped ship to the smaller religious opposition parties, and many fringe political commentators decry it as either a desperate attempt to gain absolute power or the last gasp of a dying system, but the CNA still enjoys a comfortable majority of public support. In response, the moderate opposition parties have been performing maneuvers of their own. The SDAP, despite slowly losing members to the radicals, are still the largest political party outside of the CNA itself, and the VDB has been significantly strengthened by becoming the primary focus of liberal politics, but neither is large enough to take the CNA head-on. As such, in order to safeguard the ideals of liberalism, social democracy and the moderate left in general, the VDB and SDAP have announced their cooperation in the coming elections. Together, they may not be as huge as the CNA, but they have the benefit of a solid foundation, while the CNA is still bleeding votes. Despite both being left-wing parties, their viewpoints are too far apart to truly merge as the CNA has done, but this Left List still offers the possibility of a moderate victory at the ballot box, providing an alternative to the ungainly right-wing bloc that is the CNA, which is shrinking by the day, and fringe organisations like the VNH and the Patriotten."
 holst.4.a:0 "Mijn hemel!"
 holst.5.t:0 "Worsening living standard"
 holst.5.d:0 "Ever since February 3rd, Black Monday, and the collapse of the Berlin Stock Market, the economy of the Netherlands has been suffering. Our reliance on Germany has resulted in many of our workers becoming unemployed as German companies choose to cut jobs in Holland first, spreading Syndicalist ideas among the population, and the Social Democratic Workers' Party has been gaining in numbers. Many of their ideas have merit, but in order to pass them we would have to bring them into the governing coalition."
 holst.5.a:0 "This does not bode well..."
 holst.6.t:0 "The pillars begin to crumble"
 holst.6.d:0 "Dutch society has long been highly stratified into distinct social groups, referred to as 'pillars'. These pillars all have their own social institutions: their own newspapers, broadcasting organisations, political parties, trade unions and farmers' associations, banks, schools, hospitals, universities, scouting organisations and sports clubs. Some companies even hire only personnel of a specific religion or ideology. This has lead to a situation where many people have no personal contact with people outside their own pillar. However, the recent economic crisis has shaken the established order to its core. Economic hardship has spread socialist ideology beyond its established pillar, with Syndicalists and council communists emboldened by the rhetoric emanating from Paris. At the same time, many young and unemployed from the more traditionally rightist pillars are feeling disenfranchised and abandoned by their condition, turning instead to radical nationalist parties such as the Alliance for National Reconstruction, the VNH, to restore stability and prosperity to the Kingdom of the Netherlands."
 holst.6.a:0 "Dear god, no!"
 holst.7.t:0 "Formation of the Christelijke Nationale Alliantie"
 holst.7.d:0 "For decades, the Dutch parliament has been dominated by the various religious parties.\n\nThe Calvinist ARP and CHU and Catholic RKSP have held a convincing majority in the government, and have been the source of almost all ministerial appointments.\nHowever, they can no longer count on the unconditional and unwavering support of their respective pillars. While still dominant in their own spheres, they are losing ground to the far-left and far-right fringe movements, and even among the moderate audience, the pull of the left-liberals and social-democrats is growing. With each of these parties bleeding votes, and despite their pillars' strict separation in daily life, they are now attempting to cash in on their decades-long cooperation by erasing their party lines. The formation of the Christian National Alliance, or CNA, is likely going to cost them more votes in the long run, but the consolidation of parliamentary seats and popular support still makes the CNA a political juggernaut that dwarfs all other parties.\n\nTime will tell whether this will be enough to counteract the increasing erosion of their voter base, or whether the primacy of God in politics is coming to an end....."
 holst.7.a:0 "United in faith"
 holst.8.t:0 "The Liberal Crisis"
 holst.8.d:0 "Liberalism in the Netherlands is under siege. The largest liberal party, the traditionalist LSP, has been steadily losing ground over the past years, its members, disillusioned by the perceived failures of the old system, being drawn to the radical ultranationalists of the VNH and now the promise of a large power bloc in the CNA. This has led to the left-leaning VDB becoming the largest liberal party in the country, as they are losing members at a much slower rate. Seeking to preserve the ideals of liberalism in Dutch politics, as a counterweight to radicals and authoritarians across the political spectrum, the LSP, along with most of the smaller liberal parties trailing at the lower end of the polls, has decided to fold itself into the VDB. Together, the liberals are still nowhere near as powerful as the CNA juggernaut, but with the parliamentary fragmentation of liberalism at an end, there is yet hope for a credible alternative to the conservative and increasingly authoritarian CNA."
 holst.8.a:0 "Troubling times, but the torch of liberalism is not yet extinguished"
 holst.9.t:0 "Rise of the Radical Left"
 holst.9.d:0 "After SDAP co-founder P.J. Troelstra's abortive attempt at founding the Dutch Republic in 1918, and the noncommittal response by the party's moderate wing, the more radical revolutionary elements have abandoned the social democrats in order to pursue their hopes of overthrowing the old system in more like-minded company.\n\nThe SDAP's slight drift rightwards has only emboldened their radical counterparts in the Revolutionair-Socialistische Arbeiderspartij (RSAP), a relatively small party in parliament that sees itself as Troelstra's successors, working within the system to overthrow it.\n \nEven further to the left, and outside the realm of conventional parliamentary politics, the Nationaal Arbeids-Secretariaat (NAS) is the primary syndicalist labour organisation in the Netherlands, seeking to replace the old system in its entirety and restructure it according to the French model, with tacit support from Paris.\n\nThere are even some for whom the syndicalist approach is too conservative: the 'Patriotten', the council communists rallying behind the astronomer and Marxist theorist Anton Pannekoek, see themselves as the guardians of the Marxist revolution, having many ideas in common with the ideology the Internationale recently codified as totalism.\n \nWith all these factions vying for the chance to leave their own mark on the history of the Netherlands, the parliamentary democratic system is well and truly under siege from the left."
 holst.9.a:0 "More Radical Leftists? Good god!"
 holst.10.t:0 "The Landwacht forms"
 holst.10.d:0 "In the wake of the Jordaan Riot, the police very rapidly found out that the black-shirted youths who were laying into the crowd of protestors, and who disappeared the moment the soldiers turned up, were more than just random thugs.\n They represent the first public appearance of the Landwacht, a paramilitary organisation set up by the VNH, supposedly led directly by Cornelis van Geelkerken himself. Since the Jordaan, the Landwacht has turned up all over the country, standing watch at VNH rallies and assemblies, disrupting meetings of left-wing organisations, and occasionally fighting in the streets against their syndicalist counterparts, the Nationaal Rood Front.\n Their disciplined, militaristic marches through the streets of major cities draw large crowds, and drum up more recruits, especially among the youth.\n\n The Landwacht is rapidly becoming a force to be reckoned with, and their numbers are still expanding - it's unlikely they'll stay silent during the elections....."
 holst.10.a:0 "Mijn hemel!"
 holst.11.t:0 "The Death of Van Gybland Oosterhoff"
 holst.11.d:0 "The leader of the ultra-nationalist VNH, Van Gybland Oosterhoff, died today in his home in Amsterdam. \n His last few years had seen a rapid rise in fortunes of the VNH, brought on by the economic struggles facing many in the country, fear of Syndicalism and dissilusionment with democracy. However, the party he leaves behind is highly divided itself between the young newer members of the party lead by Cornelis van Geelkerken and the older, more established segment possesing ties to the Dutch military and bureaucracy in the hands of H.N.A. Swart. \n Swart has been named the new party leader with van Geelkerken his deputy, and the pair look set to challenge the established parties for control of the Hague in the July elections - provided the two wings can keep working together."
 holst.11.a:0 "We must be careful with them..."
 holst.12.t:0 "Social Unrest in the Netherlands"
 holst.12.d:0 "The past few months have seen the growth is violent confrontations between the paramilitary bands of both the left and the right, with streetfights an almost daily occurance in the larger cities. Strikes are commonplace, with either the police or the Landwacht's 'Blackshirts' breaking the strikers' pickets. The police have failed to keep order, with the army often having to offer support, but this has only served to increase dissent and further civil disobedience. If the situation continues to escalate, the elections in May look set to be the most contentious in living memory."
 holst.12.a:0 "Bloody thugs!"
 holst.13.t:0 "The Zwolle Massacre"
 holst.13.d:0 "A Socialist rally outside Zwolle, organised by local council communists, ended in tragedy, as one of the strikers threw a bomb into the midst of the police, who were trying to disperse the crowds. Four policemen died, and the police immediately returned fire on the crowd, killing two dozen strikers. At dawn the next morning, the police, openly backed up by the local chapter of the Landwacht, arrested local socialist leaders en masse, including the nephew of Henk Sneevliet, founder and leader of the RSAP. These actions have elicited further protests throughout the country, and even the VDB is calling on Prime Minister Colijn to publicly condemn what they refer to as 'illegal detentions'."
 holst.13.a:0 "The police did well in rounding up the troublemakers so quickly."
 holst.13.b:0 "These people are innocent, and must be released at once!"
 holel.1.t:0 "Dutch Elections"
 holel.1.d:0 "With the incidents in Amsterdam and Zwolle still fresh in people's memories, the parliamentary elections are going to be hotly contested this year, and the police is out in force to deter would-be troublemakers. The CNA super-bloc currently has the strongest parliamentary position, but with the pillars teetering on the brink and voters hemorrhaging left and right their superiority at the ballot box is very much in question. However, Lijst Links, the combination of the left-liberals and moderate social democrats, can also count on a broad support base, perhaps even enough to dethrone the CNA. And there's always the spectre of radicalism waiting in the wings....."
 holel.1.a:0 "Radical Left wins"
 holel.1.b:0 "Lijst Links dethrones the CNA juggernaut!"
 holel.1.c:0 "Moderate Right wins"
 holel.1.e:0 "Radical Right wins"
 holel.2.t:0 "Moderate Right Cabinet"
 holel.2.d:0 "The CNA gamble has paid off! Despite losing a large number of voters, the confessional bloc proved to be large enough to sweep away the opposition. The godless communists have been thoroughly cowed, and appear to be laying low for the time being. Now the time has come to form the next government, the fourth Colijn cabinet. Many prominent CNA members are confident that this victory means the CNA still carries the people's mandate, and should thus form a cabinet by itself - albeit one which is only barely in the majority. However, this would upset the right-liberals who joined us to counter the syndicalist menace, without whose support we might not have won in the first place, and who are demanding a greater liberal presence in the new cabinet. Finally, some reactionaries are suggesting that this one electoral victory is not enough to deter the radical leftists, and they are floating the idea of cooperating with the VNH in order to use their resources to stamp out the red menace."

 holel.2.b:0 "CNA Course"
 holel.2.c:0 "VNH Course"
 holel.3.t:0 "Radical Right Cabinet"
 holel.3.d:0 "In such trying times as these, it's no surprise the people clamor for strong leadership to guide them. The ideals of the VNH have proven to be a strong enough rallying point that we have trounced every one of our adversaries at the ballot box, and now we take upon ourselves the task of stamping out the spectre of International Syndicalism and restoring the Kingdom of the Netherlands to the status it deserves. This is not going to be an easy road, however - in addition to the Red menace, the fractional party politicians who spend their days chattering away in Parliament will likely be fighting us every step of the way as well. We could assuage their concerns and form a proper coalition with the CNA, if only to pacify the public and make the transition easier, or we could follow our founder's programme rigorously and begin dismantling the broken-down system immediately."
 holel.3.a:0 "VNH seizes election"
 holel.3.b:0 "Form a coalition with the CNA"
 holel.3.c:0 "VNH lone rule"
 holel.4.t:0 "Radical Left Cabinet"
 holel.4.d:0 "The votes have been counted no less than three times, but the impossible has indeed happened. It seems the Dutch are fed up with the stodgy traditional politicians, and even with the moderate left, and the Revolutionary Socialist Labour Party has managed to secure the largest number of parliamentary seats. With no-one wanting to work with the CNA, and Lijst Links collapsing into bickering between the social democrats and the liberals, the RSAP is now in the perfect position to take the initiative. Reaching out to the more moderate comrades in the SDAP would secure a rather sizeable parliamentary majority, which would allow us to dismantle the system from within. Alternatively, we could simply declare the old system to be dead, and start the revolution in earnest. We should be able to count on our fellow revolutionary socialists in the NAS and the Patriotten to help us succeed, but we need to be careful, as they may try to hijack our movement for their own ends instead."
 holel.4.a:0 "RSAP seizes power"
 holel.4.b:0 "SDAP coalition"
 holel.4.c:0 "Syndicalists coup"
 holel.5.t:0 "Moderate Left Cabinet"
 holel.5.d:0 "The Lijst Links electoral alliance has successfully and soundly defeated the CNA. The increasingly authoritarian stance of the Christian Right has led to a surge in support for the moderate left, and now Colijn and his bloated, oversized party have been sent packing. However, unlike the total monolithic unification of the CNA, Lijst Links was merely an electoral alliance of convenience, and the left-liberals of the VDB and social democrats of the SDAP still retain their separate parties, with their own programmes and ideals. The few half-hearted efforts towards further unification have been shouted down, and so Lijst Links is no more. This means that the votes have to be re-counted to determine which of these two parties managed to secure the most seats in Parliament. The victor turns out to be....."
 holel.5.a:0 "SDAP led coalition"
 holel.5.b:0 "VDB Majority"
 holsdap.1.t:0 "The SDAP secures a majority"
 holsdap.1.d:0 "The SDAP's growing public support has paid off in a big way. The votes have been tallied, and not only has the SDAP managed to gain the majority of the Lijst Links votes, it has won a landslide victory and actually enjoys a small, but comfortable parliamentary majority, with even the CNA relegated to the sidelines. This has sparked a massive debate within the party regarding which course to take. There is a large moderate lobby which advocates abandoning the last vestiges of revolutionary thought, and to form a coalition with the VDB liberals in order to cement our position as a legitimate part of the political landscape. Others claim that our majority position means we alone have the mandate of the people, and that we should thus forge ahead on our own. Finally, some suggest that we should return to our roots, and seize this opportunity to start a revolution within the system, seeking out the help of the RSAP in establishing a socialist state."
 holsdap.1.a:0 "Oke!"
 holvdb.1.t:0 "The VDB secures a majority"
 holvdb.1.d:0 "The votes have been counted, and it seems the Dutch have not lost their trust in liberalism. The VDB is now set to lead the first liberal cabinet since the Weltkrieg - but we do not have the support base to do it alone. The decision now is where to find that support. The party is split between those who want to work with the SDAP, and those who want to work with the CNA. The social democratic ideal may be quite different from the liberal one, but both parties are averse to extremism and authoritarianism on either end of the political spectrum, and the fairly broad public support for the SDAP would help cement the VDB's position. Plus, both parties have already proven they can work together, if only to win an election. On the other hand, the CNA is more well-established in politics and has closer ties to the bureaucracy and the military, its constituent parties have decades of experience running the government, not to mention the sizeable contingent of right-liberals in their ranks, who would be happy to form a stronger, more centrist liberal bloc. Now the VDB must decide which of these two it wishes to partner up with."

However, one of the strikers threw a bomb into the midst of the police, who returned fire into the crowd with their pistols. 4 policemen and two dozen strikers were left dead, and the next day the local authorities hanged 4 SDAP leaders, all of whom were on the speaker's podium at the time. There are growing calls to compromise with the SDAP, as more and more of the population turns against the government."

 hol.8.t:0 "The Plan for Labor"
 hol.8.d:0 "Now that the SDAP is in power, after being denied for twenty years by various right-wing coalitions, it can begin to implement its Plan for Labor, created after Black Monday to improve economic conditions. The Plan for Labor includes ideas to increase employment, nationalize vital industries, and implementing a system of unemployment benefits, by devaluating the Gilder and allowing the national debt to rise, alongside other more extreme methods."

 #### Foci Events ####
 hol.200.t:0 "The Dutch Army Plan"
 hol.200.d:0 "Tensions are running high around us, causing our army staff to hold a meeting to decide upon a doctrine for our army.\n The more traditional part of our general staff wishes to concentrate on the defense our country, repairing and reactivating the traditional defensive lines making use of the water to stop the enemy.\n However, some note that these tactics may not work anymore due to the changing nature of warfare, and have expressed that the Dutch army should be a highly mobile force capable with motorised troops and tanks to respond to threats quickly and decisivly.\n More naval orientedd officers however see the role of the army to be a subsidary of our naval force, with an army of specialists conducting operations around our empire allowing for a small but highly efficient army while the navy keeps the enemy at bay."
 hol.200.a:0 "We need to make Holland an unimpentrable fortress!"
 hol.200.b:0 "Our army is useless cowering in bunkers, trucks and tanks are what we need."
 hol.200.c:0 "We are nothing without our empire, and we need the naval and marines to protect it!"
 hol.201.t:0 "The Future of the Dutch Navy"
 hol.201.d:0 "The Admirality is discussing the best way to proceed onwards. Our resources are limited, so a plan is needs to be devised on how to make use of our naval assets the most.\n\n Some of the admirality place our merchant fleet above all. They believe that if we merchant fleet is unable to operate, our country will be reduced to poverty. They want to emphasise the need of our navy to protect the fleet with fast surface ships, and if possible harrass the fleet of potential adversaries with submarines.\n Arguments to focus on large surface ships to protect our vital colonies from a potential Japanese incursion are also heared. Our capital ships are reaching an respectable vintage and will probably not be able to protect the Dutch East Indies in particular if they are not modernised or even expanded in number.\n\n Some propose the Dutch navy to focus on naval aviation, a relatively new but potentially radically altering the way how naval battles are fought in the future. They wish to see a further expansion of the carrier force supported by a strong naval aviation branch."
 hol.201.a:0 "Our merchant fleet needs to be protected at all times."
 hol.201.b:0 "The Japanese are indeed an ever growing threat, we must focus on our capital ships."
 hol.201.c:0 "Battleships are just floating pieces of scrap, focus on the carrier force!"
 hol.202.t:0 "Construct a new refinery on Curaçao?"
 hol.202.d:0 "Curaçao lies in close proximity to the oil producing Venezuela. Seeing the opportunity this presents, Royal Dutch Shell has asked the government to lease a large piece of land near Willemstad to construct a new refinery.\n\n If we agree to this, we will also need to construct new docking facilities for oil tankers to enter and leave the harbour.\n\nThe construction of the refinery will give a massive economic boost to the Dutch Antilles, however it might put us on odds against Venezuela... especially considering the fact that they claim these islands as theirs."
 hol.202.a:0 "We can never have enough oil, proceed!"
 hol.202.b:0 "Actually, we have enough oil already... never mind."
 hol.203.t:0 "Willemstad refinery completed!"
 hol.203.d:0 "The work on the new refinery and nessecary harbour facilities is being finished and the new refinery on the heart of Curaçao has been put into operation!"

 holfocus.4.t:0 "The search for resources"
 holfocus.4.d:0 "Although the vast majority of our resources come from our colonies, our homeland should also harbour some resources we have not yet unconvered.\n\nGeological surveys in Brabant have found traces of tungsten, a resource we thus far completly lack. Furthermore, we can dig deeper in our mines in southern Limburg and perhaps find usuable iron for our smelters to produce steel from."
 holfocus.4.a:0 "We could really use the Tungsten."
 holfocus.4.b:0 "Less reliance on foreign steel would be nice."
 holfocus.4.c:0 "Why not both? We'll pay for it! Somehow...."

 hol.301.d:0 "We have never attempted to acquire, let alone produce tanks for the Netherlands. With all of our potential adversaries possessing tanks, we must not fall behind.\n\nGermany might be willing to sell us their Katze Sturmpanzer designs, and perhaps we can negociate a deal to produce our first tank based on this design as well."
 hol.301.a:0 "Only buy tanks, we do not have the capacity to produce our own."

We can try to industralise the colony rapidly which will be beneficial for both us and the natives. However, we must keep in mind that pushing too hard might trigger some unwanted concequences..."
 holdei.1.a:0 "We have tried to build a beneficial relationship with the natives, yet they responded with a revolt. Begin preparations to exploit the Indies for our gain!"

 holdei.2.t:0 "A greater autonomy for the Netherlands East Indies?"
 holdei.2.d:0 "The people of the Netherlands East Indies have been calling for their independence. While maintaining colonies has been difficult these past years, we would lose many of our resources that are generated from the area. Increasing hostilities in the area have also threatened our colony."

 holnavy.1.t:0 "A new Heavy Cruiser design"
 holnavy.1.d:0 "The only 'heavy cruiser' currently in service is the 'Panterschip' (Armoured Cruiser) Soerabaja, her only redeeming quality at this point being her size which makes her a nice target.\n\nWe can choose to design a new 'Pantserschip', with large guns and decent armour for a cruiser her size which comes at the cost of speed.\nFurthermore, the Wilton-Fijenoord shipyard has several proposals they can work out for us, including a fast and manouvrable ship intended for use in the colonies, or a contempary heavy cruiser design designed for coastal protection, still retaining a good ammount of guns but lacking armour."
